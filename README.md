## üåé About

ModProxy is a module for [NProxy](https://github.com/nfense/NProxy) which aims to handle web requests from one point to another through a node used as a proxy. This allows to safeguard the integrity of the target server under the node. At the same time this module can function as a load balancer adding several target servers.

## ToDo

- [x] Proxy HTTP Request.  
- [ ] Improve Load Balancer.
